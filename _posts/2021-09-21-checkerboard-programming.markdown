My side-project for the last couple of months was [checkerboardprogramming.com](https://www.checkerboardprogramming.com), a small series of programming challenges where you write javascript to match checkerboard color patterns.

I was reminiscing about exercises you do when learning to program, such as printing squares, triangles, checkerboards and circles:
```
      &&&&&&&&          *               # # # # # #                                      
      &&&&&&&&          **               # # # # #               @@@@              
      &&&&&&&&          ***             # # # # # #            @@@@@@@@            
      &&&&&&&&          ****             # # # # #            @@@@@@@@@@            
      &&&&&&&&          *****           # # # # # #            @@@@@@@@            
      &&&&&&&&          ******           # # # # #               @@@@              
      &&&&&&&&          *******         # # # # # #                                      
```
This got me curious about what patterns could be made with (relatively) simple programs, and I wanted to set these up as accessible challenges.


It was a fun project!
