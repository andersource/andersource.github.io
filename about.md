Hi! I'm Daniel, a machine learning research engineer. [Work with me](/work_together/) \| [CV](/cv/)

You'll probably learn more about me reading the rest of the site, so in the meantime here's an ascii cat:

{% include cat.html  %}

### [Unoffice hours](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours)
Let's chat on whatever! Feel free to [book a slot](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0Qu_XFIljIBbwAHr6WKaEY4LjwA4xOqdiAFNV332qTG41pxFmN_RK2GsLUohL1ZSvAwOuOOifZ), or contact me: [hi@andersource.dev](mailto:hi@andersource.dev)

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Buy me a coffee (or, more likely, a cookie) on [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/andersource).
