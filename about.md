Hi! I'm Daniel, a software engineer and data scientist. [Work with me](/work_together/) \| [CV](/cv/)

You'll probably learn more about me reading the rest of the site, so in the meantime here's an ascii cat:

{% include cat.html  %}

Feel free to contact me: [hi@andersource.dev](mailto:hi@andersource.dev)

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
